# 3Deploy
We created a Flask frontend website connected to the 3DHouse-original code that can plot a house from an address entered from a Flask StringField on the frontpage. 
Because of both me (Kristof) and Chirag had Tech Talks and Chirag had extra laptop issues, being backing up data, reinstalling Ubuntu OS, software etc, 
we didn't get to realizing our full potential in deploying the 3D House on Heroku. We stayed stuck on where we were Tuesday and didn't get so much further. We had issues with the database part
the assignment and it was also quite unclear to us how to proceed with the huge amount of geospatial data. We did explore many paths but failed to really steer into the 
right direction. I think both of us need more time exploring databases and so we will follow up on that during our holiday.
